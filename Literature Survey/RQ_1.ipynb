        "\n",
        "the working of this method is as follows:\n",
        "*   Assume y(t) = x(t) + n(t) where x(t) is the clean sound and n(t) is the noise, is taken as the input\n",
        "*   Then input which is in time domain is converted into frequency domain using techniques like Fast Fourir Transform (FFT) in the next step\n",
        "*   Once the audio is in frequenxy domain, power spectral density (PSD) is estimated of both noise input and clean sound then its passed to the wiener filter\n",

        "\n",
        "This denoising technique is used in the paper \"An Improved Wavelet Denoising Algorithm Based on Principal Component Analysis\". PCA techniques requires both noisy sound input and clean sound. The disadvantage of PCA is when noise is complex or non-stationary but can be used as preprocessing step before other denoising techniques to improve the results.\n",

        "The procedure involved in PCA is as follows:\n",
        "*   At first, the input audio is converted into frequency domian by STFT\n",
        "*   Then PCA is applied on training part to get principal componenets which is direction of maximum variance\n",
        "*   When PCA is appiled, feature projection takes place where both noisy and clean audio samples is projected onto reduced-dimensional subspace after calculating its principal components\n",
        "*    In reduced dimensional subspace, denoising is done. one common approach is thresholding.\n",
        "*    After denoising, the output is converted back to original space by performing inverse PCA\n",

        "\n",
        "*   At first the wavelet tranform is done on the input sound to decompose it into different frequenct components. The wavelet transform helps to represent signal in both frquency and time domain.\n",
        "*   After decomposition, each frequency composition is analysed. then thresholding techniques are applied on each wavelet coefficient to remove/shrink the coefficients below certain threshold (attenuate noise while preserving the true sound)(with the assumption that noise often appears at small-amplitude coefficients, while important signal occurs at large components)\n",
        "*   Then the decomposed wavelets compositions are combined by performing inverse wavelet transform to get denoised PCG. The threshold levels are tuned to obtain desired level of clean audio sounds.\n",

        "\n",
        "This method is referred from the research paper \"NOISE FILTERING USING EMPIRICAL MODE DECOMPOSITION\". This techniques is particularly used for analysing non-linear and non-stationary data. The main idea behind this method is to decompose the signal to main sets called Intrinsic Mode Functions (IMFs) and then capture different scales of variation wrt these IMFs. EMD can be used on non-stationary and complex data.\n",

        "*   Then thresholding is applied on those noisy components to remove the noise to obtain the denoised IMFs\n",
        "*   At last, all the denoised IMFs are combined to get denoised audio. Quality assessment is done to ensure important features of signal are not removed and also noise is removed.\n",

        "Variational mode decomposition is similar to EDM. The main signal is decomposed into multiple parts called IMFs. In the IMFs, number of local extrema and zero crossings differ at most by 1. In this method, Hilbert transformation is used in the decompostion of the IMFs. \"VDM behaves like a Wiener Filter: It is like a low-narrowband filter that only passes a range of frequencies around a low center frequency. The central frequency w is nearly 0. Because of that we have a low Variation from the center frequency. Minimize bandwidth across center frequency for each mode. So we get Modes with a minimal Bandwidth. But the Sum of all modes must be the original Signal.\" The main parameter of VDM is K (number of IMFs)\n",

        "*   decompose main signal into K number of IMFs: In this steps, decomposed IMFs frequencies are from low to high\n",
        "*   Energy analysis: The frequency spectrum is concentrated on the lower-order modes so signal energy is very large at the low-order components. and the signal Energy starts also from strong to weak, because the energy based on signal and noise behaves differently in the IMFs. So in this step, we search the point where the low-order energy drops rapidly. It is marked as the signal and noise boundary point\n",
